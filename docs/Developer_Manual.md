# Install ABM

## Installation scripts (Linux only)
* Download the files found at abm/docs/abm_install and put them into a directory ${DIRECTORY} where you want to install ABM.
* Run the installation script: 
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}
  $ sudo bash ./abm_install.sh
  ```
  * You will be prompted for your MySQL root password. If MySQL is already installed on your machine, provide the existing root password. If not, choose one.
    * To determine if MySQL is already installed on your machine, run `$ mysql`.
    * Some steps of the installations script may take several minutes. While waiting, you can consult the log files to check on the advancement of the installation.
    * If the script fails at any point, consult the log file to fix the error and re-run the script. It will skip the parts that are already done.
* Once the installation finishes, restart your machine.
* Fill in the correct information in the [configuration files](#configuration-information) of ABM.
* Continue with the installation instructions from the [Eclipse set-up](#set-up-eclipse). You don't need to install Eclipse, it is already done.
  
## Complete installation (Linux and MacOS)
The installation of ABM is not recommended on Windows. We advise Windows users to dual boot their installation with Linux or to use a VM. Note that ABM tends to be a bit slow on a VM, depending on the capabilities of the host machine.

### Set up the ABM workspace
* Install a package manager
  * Linux: apt-get
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install
  $ sudo apt-get update
  ```
  * MacOS: Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)
  ```
  $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  ```
* Install Java
  * Linux
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install default-jre
  $ sudo apt-get install default-jdk
  ```
  * MacOS `$ brew cask install java`
* Clone the ABM repository in the directory of your choice: ${DIRECTORY}
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}
  $ git clone https://github.com/nguyenLisa/abm.git
  ```
* Set up the [configuration information](#configuration-information), except for the SQL credentials.
* Copy the files contained in ${DIRECTORY}/abm/hermes_config into the directory ${HERMES_CONFIG_DIR}. Give your user ${USER} read, write, and execute rights on them.
  ```
  $ sudo mkdir ${HERMES_CONFIG_DIR}
  $ sudo cp ${DIRECTORY}/abm/hermes_config/* ${HERMES_CONFIG_DIR}
  $ sudo chown -R ${USER} ${HERMES_CONFIG_DIR}
  ```
* Create the ABM workspace and give your user ${USER} read, write, and execute rights on them.
  ```
  $ sudo mkdir ${WORKSPACE_ROOT}
  $ sudo mkdir ${WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY}
  $ chown -R ${USER} ${WORKSPACE_ROOT}
  $ chown -R ${USER} ${WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY}
  ```  
  
### Set up Docker
* Download and install Docker Community Edition
  * Linux
  ```
  $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  $ sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
  ```
  * MacOS `$ brew install docker`
* Add your user to the docker group, so that you have access to docker: `$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}`
* Create local volumes:
  ```
  $ docker volume create --name IVY_REPO -d local
  $ docker volume create --name M2_REPO -d local
  ```
* Create the sbt build image:
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}/abm/docker_files/abm-sbt-0.13.13-jdk-8
  $ docker build -t abm/sbt:01313-jdk-8 .
  ```
* Create the maven build image:
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}/abm/docker_files/abm-maven-3-jdk-7
  $ docker build -t abm/maven:3-jdk-7 .
  ```
* Create the gradle build Image:
  `$ docker pull gradle`
* Create the ant build image:
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}/abm/docker_file/abm-ant-1.10.1-jdk-8
  $ docker build -t abm/ant:1.10.1-jdk-8 .
  ```
* Pull the Hermes image: `$ docker pull opalj/sbt_scala_javafx`
* Verify that the three images are running. You should see abm/ant, gradle, abm/sbt, abm/maven, and opalj/sbt_scala_javafx when running `$ docker images`

### Set up the database
* Install MySQL Community Server >= 5.5
  * Linux
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install mysql-server
  $ mysql_secure_installation
  ```
  * MacOS
  ```
  $ brew install mysql
  $ mysql_secure_installation
  ```
  * **Do not forget your root password.**
* Optional: If you do not want ABM to use the mysql root account, you can create your own account and grant it all privileges.
  ```
  $ mysql -uroot -p
  $ CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  $ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
  $ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  $ exit
  ```
* Set up the SQL credentials in the ABM [configuration files](#configuration-files).
* Create the abm database
  ```
  $ mysql -uroot -p
  $ create database abm;
  $ exit
  ```
* Create the useradmin datatables
  ```
  $ cd ${DIRECTORY}/abm/bnd-workspace
  $ mysql -u root -p -D abm < de.fraunhofer.abm.useradmin.dao.jdbc/useradmin_ddl.sql
  $ mysql -u root -p -D abm < ../docs/abm.sql
  ```
  
### Set up Eclipse 
* Download and install Eclipse for **Java Developers** (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
* Start Eclipse with the workspace directory set to ${DIRECTORY}/abm/eclipse_workspace
* Install bndtools from the Market Place (Help > Eclipse Marketplace). Make sure to install version 3.5.
* Optional: Install Webclipse (Angular) from the Market Place (Help > Eclipse Marketplace)
* Import the source code of ABM 
  * File > Import > General > Existing projects into Workspace
  * Point the root directory to ${DIRECTORY}/abm/bnd-workspace
  * Select all projects.
  * Uncheck "Copy projects into workspace"
* Wait for the workspace to finish building. If compilation errors appear in the code (except for the test project), they should be solved before continuing.
* Open the file abm/bnd-workspace/de.fraunhofer.abm.collection.dao.jpa/configuration/configuration.json and modify the database configurations: replace the user and password by the mysql user and password that you have created when [installing the database](#set-up-the-database). If you haven't created a user, you can use "root" as the user and the root password as the configuration password.
* Open or create the file cnf/build.bnd and modify the felix.webconsole.username and the felix.webconsole.password
* Generate the rest of the database:
  * Open the file persistence.xml in de.fraunhofer.abm.collection.dao.jpa
  * Uncomment <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create" /> (this line enables the database generation from the JPA entities. this has to be done only when the JPA entities change or for the setup)
  * Launch ABM (see [Launch ABM](#launch-abm))
  * Close ABM by clicking on the red square in the Eclipse Console.
  * Comment <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create" /> back.

### Launch ABM
* Before launching, make sure that:
  * mysql should be running `service mysql status`
    * If it is not the case, start mysql: `service mysql start` 
  * The docker images for Maven, SBT, and Hermes should show up in `docker images` (abm/maven, abm/sbt, opalj/sbt_scala_javafx). 
    * If this is not the case, set up docker again.
    * If docker is not running, launch it `docker run -it ubuntu`
* Launch the application:
  * Open de.fraunhofer.abm.app/de.fraunhofer.abm.bndrun
  * Click on Run OSGi in the top right corner
  * The website can then be accessed at http://localhost:8080/de.fraunhofer.abm/index.html#/
* **If it is your first time launching the application, close it by clicking on the red square in the Eclipse console, and comment <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="drop-and-create" /> back in the file de.fraunhofer.abm.collection.dao.jpa/persistence.xml**

### Create the demo user
All users are managed by the OSGi UserAdmin service, which can be accessed through the system console.
* Launch ABM (see [Launch ABM](#launch-abm))
* Open your browser and access the system console http://localhost:8080/system/console
* The username and password to access the user console are defined in config.bnd in de.fraunhofer.abm.app
* Go to OSGi -> Users
* Create a group Admin
* Create a group RegisteredUser
* Create a group UserAdmin
* Create a user "demo"
  * Move it to RegisteredUser
  * Select the user "demo"
  * Under credentials, add an entry:
    * Key `password`
    * Type `String`
    * Value `K25eHhV5v/qByG8oTP2VySQ4iPv4ZPFr0Bkf3uTnTwA=$lSghSVxaYoDynPR7B3LChprsbvvYP2M8lEKI9SWH52g=` This is a salted password hash containing the password "demo" if you want to create your own password, you can use the main method of the class Password in de.fraunhofer.abm.security. 
    
* **You are done with the installation. Congratulations!** 

# Configuration information

* The file build.bnd in cnf contains the application configuration information: webconsole credentials and settings, admin email information, Google token and GitHub token. Replace the values of the configuration information with your own.
* The file Configuration.java in de.fraunhofer.abm.suitebuilder contains "Workspace Root" which you can adjust to fit your development machine. Make sure that your ${USER} has read, write, and execute accesses to this directory and its sub-directories: `$ sudo chown -R ${USER} ${WORKSPACE_ROOT}`
* The file Configuration.java in de.fraunhofer.abm.repoarchive.local contains "Directory" which you can adjust to fit your development machine. Make sure that your ${USER} has read, write, and execute accesses to this directory and its sub-directories: `$ sudo chown -R ${USER} ${WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY}`
* The file HermesConfiguration.java in de.fraunhofer.abm.hermes.impl contains "hermesConfigDir()". By default, you can set it to ${DIRECTORY}/abm/hermes_config. Else, you can adust to fit your development machine. Make sure that your ${USER} has read, write, and execute accesses to this directory and its sub-directories: `$ sudo chown -R ${USER} ${HERMES_CONFIG_DIR}` Make sure to keep the Hermes configuration files in this directory (docker.sh, queryfeaturemap.json, application.conf, and hermes.json). You can find the files in hermes_config in this repository.
* The files configuration.json in de.fraunhofer.abm.collection.dao.jpa and configuration.json in de.fraunhofer.abm.useradmin.dao.jdbc contain the sql credentials that ABM uses to access the tables. Make sure that they match existing mysql credentials. You can use the MySQL root credentials or another account that you can create as follows:
  ```
  $ mysql -uroot -p
  $ CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  $ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
  $ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  $ exit
  ```

# Launching or bouncing the application on production server
* Install ABM as shown in the installation section
* Go to the /opt/abm
* Run the command in start file residing at that location
* Check the process is running or not through the following command -> ps -ef | grep abm

* Note: In order to avoid the details of the REST APIs to be displayed on the server when an error is created, the Apache configurations (/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default-ssl.conf) can be modified to add the following lines:
  ```
  ProxyErrorOverride On
  ErrorDocument 500 "Error 500"
  ErrorDocument 404 "Error 404"
  ```

# Running Hermes manually
* Install docker toolbox on windows or Linux as given above.
* Make sure you have configured your docker machine with enough memory as Hermes application requires a good amount of memory.
* You can check the limit of your machine using following command - docker-machine inspect
* You can create your machine using following command to allocate enough memory to your machine.
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory 8192 default (you can choose your machine name)
* Command to remove the existing docker-machine 
docker-machine rm default (machine name is default)
* Pull the Docker Opal Image using following command 
docker pull opalj/sbt_scala_javafx (Refer the link :- https://hub.docker.com/r/opalj/sbt_scala_javafx/ in case of any help)
* Run the Docker image using following command
docker run -it --rm opalj/sbt_scala_javafx
* Result of run command will take you to the following prompt 
     root@743e2cf42ff1:~/OPAL#
* run sbt command 
* change the project to OPAL-DeveloperTools using following command - project OPAL-DeveloperTools
* Run the hermes application using following command 
runMain org.opalj.hermes.HermesCLI  -config src/main/resources/hermes.json -statistics $csv.csv (You can give any name you want for CSV file)
* You will get the csv file in DEVELOPING_OPAL/tools directory or can specify the directory where you want.
  
# Updating the Database
While the database is automatically generated during setup, when a installation of ABM is updated some modifications to the local database may be needed.
The changes can be made by reinitilizing the database, but that results in the loss of all data stored on the database.
To avoid this, make the following changes to your local database for each of the new commits you are applying.
* Commit 983a572 (Jun 9, 2017 / Added simple public collection feature)
  * To table "collection":
    * Add column "privateStatus" (type tinyint, default 0)
    * Add column "creation_date" (type datetime)
    * Commit 983a572 (Jun 9, 2017 / Added simple public collection feature)
* Commit f5fa5cd (Jul 5, 2017 / Added Pinning Collections and Simple Build Sidebar)
  * Add new table "collectionPin" with the following colunms:
    * Column "user" (type varchar(255))
    * Column "id" (type varchar(255))
  * Add new table "filterPin" with the following colunms:
    * Column "user" (type varchar(255))
    * Column "id" (type varchar(255))
* Commit 162dff7 (Aug 4, 2017 / Bugfixes and UI changes)
  * Add new table "user" with the following colunms:
    * Column "name" (type varchar(255))
    * Column "password" (type varchar(255))
    * Column "approved" (type tinyint)
* Commit 7364e14 (Nov 27, 2017/ Registration activation)
  * To table "user":
    * Column "token" (type varchar(50))

# Changing email notification settings
All the settings that control the email notification system are at the top of the file EmailConfiguration.java in the package de.fraunhofer.abm.app. You can change these to control the host the program connects to, the email and credentals it uses, and who it notifies when a new account is registered.

# Continuous integration using jenkins

Abm uses Jenkins for deployment. Every day the code from master will deployed into the server.
Let's see how deployment is done.

* There is seperate github account for abm deployment.
* Jenkins dashboard:
![Jenkins Dashboard](Jenkins.png)
* Build is done daily at midnight.
* Using Systemd ABM jar file has been created as a service.
* From the server, ABM can be started and stopped using 

```
systemctl start abm
systemctl stop abm
```
* Before deployment `abm service` will be stopped and after the creation of new jar file abm service will be started.

* In case, immediately build can be done using Build Now option in jenkins.
